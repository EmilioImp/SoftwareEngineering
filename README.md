This is the repository for the project "Progetto di Ingegneria del Software" (Software Engineering Project) by Politecnico di Milano.  

The project was made by Francesco Lorenzo, Emilio Imperiali and Edoardo Lamonaca, it's a digital version of the board game "Sagrada" by Floodgate Games.  
  
Requirements included:  
-Using MVC  
-Allowing both Socket and RMI connections  
-Allowing the client to choose between a simple JavaFX GUI and a CLI  
-Hosting more than one game at a time

## Description
Repository of the project developed for the "Prova finale di Ingegneria del Software" (Final test of Software Engineering) course, part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

This fianl test aims at assessing the students' ability to design a complex software system given the requirements of all the stakeholders.

This repository refers to the 2018 edition of the course, whose main topic is an online multiplayer board game called Sagrada, that has to be implemented using Java.

## Executables
The executables are the .jar files in the root of the repository. One is for the server, and two for the clients (either using CLI or a simple JavaFX GUI).

The project has been developed with the following technologies:
- Backend: Java
- Frontend: JavaFx
